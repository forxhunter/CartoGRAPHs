# CartoGRAPHs
### A Framework for Multidimensional Explicit Network Visualization

A work in progress Project for interpretable Network Visualizations, with a focus on biological networks in two and three dimensions.

#### **How to use**

The Code can be run using Jupyter Notebook/Lab. The main script for producing Layouts for the Protein-Protein Interaction Network (homo sapiens or saccharomyces cerevisiae) is entitled "cartographs_main.ipynb" with the python functions included in "cartographs_main.py". 

#### **Benchmarks** 

Model networks with well-known architecture, such as Cayley Tree, Cubic Grid and Torus Lattice were used to benchmark the framework. The scripts regarding all benchmarking figures can be found in the folder "benchmarks". The network distances for all model network sizes, which are required to run the scripts were precalculated and can be downloaded from here and shall be located in the folder "benchmark" after unzipping.
